If you want to relive this nostalgic game on your PC, you will need a few things:
 
- A copy of the original game CD or an ISO file. You can find the ISO file online from various sources, such as [My Abandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/the-house-of-the-dead-bed) [^1^]. Make sure you download the Windows version, not the Sega Saturn version.
- A CD-ROM emulator or a virtual drive software. This will allow you to mount the ISO file as a virtual CD and bypass the CD check. You can use programs like [DAEMON Tools Lite](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite) or [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) for this purpose.
- A no-CD patch or a crack. This will remove the need for the CD-ROM emulator and make the game run faster and smoother. You can find the no-CD patch or crack online from various sources, such as [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_the_house_of_the_dead.shtml) [^2^]. Make sure you download the patch or crack that matches your game version.
- A controller or a light gun. The game was designed to be played with a light gun, but you can also use a controller or a mouse. However, using a controller or a mouse will make the game easier and less challenging. If you want to use a light gun, you will need a compatible device and software, such as [Sinden Lightgun](https://www.sindenlightgun.com/) or [DemulShooter](https://github.com/argonlefou/DemulShooter).

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Install the game from the CD or the ISO file. You may need to run the setup.exe file in compatibility mode for Windows 95 or 98.
2. Copy the no-CD patch or crack to the game directory and overwrite the original THOTD.EXE file.
3. Run the game from the patched or cracked THOTD.EXE file. You may need to run it in compatibility mode for Windows 95 or 98.
4. Configure the game settings according to your preferences. You can choose between arcade mode and PC mode, adjust the difficulty and lives, toggle the reload option and blood color, and select your language and audio.
5. Enjoy playing The House of the Dead 1 on your PC!

If you encounter any problems or errors while playing the game, you can try some of these solutions:
